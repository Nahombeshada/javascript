#Javascript conditional statment

> Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.

There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:

“If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
“Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.
“Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.

#Javascript loops.

> Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false .

#Javascript methods.

> JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.
